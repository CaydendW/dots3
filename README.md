## Notes
This is not my color scheme. It was created by [EliverLara](https://github.com/EliverLara/).  
The Github repo cand be found [here](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet).  
That being said, I did write the majority of the colors here. The only work that is not mine is the VSCode (Found under .vscode/extensions/eliverlara.sweet-vscode-1.1.1) and the GTK theme (Found under the Sweet-Dark.tar.xz).  
Icon theme is [Tela](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme)
